== Logging setup

This package provides additional facilities around use of slf4j:

* Logging based on java prinf strings over slf4j -- LogFmt.
* Control of logging such as changing log level dynmically 
  (good for testing) -- LogCtl.
* LoggingSetup: abstract away from logging setup and alway provide a default.
